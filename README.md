![Project Logo](./assets/project_logo.png)\
Experimental Flight Computer with potential mitigations of previous issues faced by FLYTE and a testbed for new systems.

Version descriptions: \
\
Ember pilot version: Pilot version of the flight computer for a proof of concept for new LoRa telemetry. The end goal is to make sure all of the systems behave reliably and validate them for the future versions. This board will feature a RPi Pico 2 dev board instead of a bare metal hardware design. 
\
Ember V1: Flight computer which will feature a bare metal hardware design with RP2354B MCU, full SMD design, 4-layer stackup adopting all the reliability verified systems from the pilot version.
